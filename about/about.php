        Hello, I am very tired when writing this page, and I apologize for not styling it. <br><br>
        There might be bugs or some catastrophic failures as I have not done extensive testings on this.<br><br>
        If you would like to talk to me about something on this page, you can find me at h1119623520@gmail.com. <br><br>
        I am a broke college student and if you want to hire a developer please contact me at the email listed above. .
