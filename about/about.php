        I am very tired when writing this page, and I apologize for not styling it. ( I might do it later who knows ) <br><br>

        Currently there is only support for power comparison( 06, 2022 ). I might add support for cadence and other metrics down the road. <br><br><br><br>
        
        There might be bugs or some catastrophic failures as I have not done extensive testings on this.<br><br>
        If you would like to talk to me about something on this page, you can find me at h1119623520@gmail.com. <br><br>
        I am a broke college student and if you want to hire a developer please contact me at the email listed above. <br><br><br><br>
